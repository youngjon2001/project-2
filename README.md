# How smoking impacts health metrics

## Project overview
This data analytics project explores how smoking affects key cardiovascular health indicators such as heart rate, blood pressure, and cholesterol across different age groups and sexes. Using a dataset of 3,900 individuals, we aim to discover statistically significant patterns and differences between current smokers and non-smokers.

##  Data structure overview
Rows: 3,900 participants

Key Columns:

age (numeric)

sex (male/female)

current_smoker (yes/no)

heart_rate (bpm)

blood_pressure (string, e.g., "120/80")

cigs_per_day (numeric, some missing)

chol (cholesterol level)

## Executive summary
#### More Non-Smokers:
The dataset contains more non-smokers than current smokers.

#### Cigarette Use Among Smokers:
Smokers consume an average of 18.58 cigarettes per day.

#### Cholesterol Levels:
Non-smokers have slightly higher cholesterol levels than smokers.

#### Age Comparison:
There is no significant age difference between smokers and non-smokers.

#### Common Blood Pressure:
The most frequent blood pressure reading is 130/80.

#### Heart Rate:
Smokers have a slightly higher heart rate than non-smokers.

## Insights
Smoking Distribution
Analysis reveals that the dataset contains a greater number of non-smokers than smokers. This suggests a larger representation of individuals who have either never smoked or quit smoking.

Average Cigarette Consumption
Among current smokers, the average number of cigarettes smoked per day is approximately 18.58. This reflects moderate to heavy smoking patterns among active smokers.

Cholesterol Levels
The cholesterol levels of non-smokers are slightly higher than those of smokers. This may seem counterintuitive, but it suggests that cholesterol is influenced by multiple factors beyond smoking alone, such as diet, genetics, or physical activity.

Age Differences
There is no significant difference in the age distribution between smokers and non-smokers when using descriptive statistics. Both groups span similar age ranges, with comparable mean and median ages.

## Recommendations
Strengthen Smoking Cessation Programs
While smokers are fewer in number, they consume an average of nearly 19 cigarettes per day, which is relatively high. This indicates a need for targeted intervention programs focused not just on quitting, but also on reducing consumption levels.

Monitor Heart Health in Smokers
The slightly elevated heart rate among smokers suggests early signs of cardiovascular stress. Healthcare providers should prioritize regular heart rate monitoring and cardiovascular screening for smokers, even those who appear otherwise healthy.

Investigate Cholesterol Trends Further
The unexpected finding that non-smokers have slightly higher cholesterol warrants deeper exploration. It’s important to assess other lifestyle and dietary habits, as this may be influenced by factors unrelated to smoking.

Promote Preventive Health Across All Age Groups
Since there is no major age difference between smokers and non-smokers, awareness and preventive education should be made age-inclusive, not just targeted at younger or older populations.

Blood Pressure Management
The most common blood pressure reading was 130/80, which falls into a “prehypertensive” range. It is recommended that both smokers and non-smokers be educated on managing blood pressure through lifestyle changes, stress management, and early screenings.

Combine Lifestyle Screening Tools
Since smoking alone does not fully explain variations in cholesterol or blood pressure, implement comprehensive health screenings that assess smoking, diet, activity levels, and genetic predispositions together.

Most Common Blood Pressure Reading
The most frequently recorded blood pressure in the dataset is 130/80. This falls within the range classified as “elevated” or “pre-hypertension,” depending on clinical context.

Heart Rate Comparison
Smokers show a slightly higher average heart rate compared to non-smokers. This is consistent with the physiological effects of nicotine, which is known to stimulate the cardiovascular system.
