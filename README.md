# How smoking impacts health metrics

## Project overview
This data analytics project explores how smoking affects key cardiovascular health indicators such as heart rate, blood pressure, and cholesterol across different age groups and sexes. Using a dataset of 3,900 individuals, we aim to discover statistically significant patterns and differences between current smokers and non-smokers.
