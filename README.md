# How smoking impacts health metrics

## Project overview
This data analytics project explores how smoking affects key cardiovascular health indicators such as heart rate, blood pressure, and cholesterol across different age groups and sexes. Using a dataset of 3,900 individuals, we aim to discover statistically significant patterns and differences between current smokers and non-smokers.

##  Data structure overview
Rows: 3,900 participants

Key Columns:

age (numeric)

sex (male/female)

current_smoker (yes/no)

heart_rate (bpm)

blood_pressure (string, e.g., "120/80")

cigs_per_day (numeric, some missing)

chol (cholesterol level)

## Executive summary
Smoking Distribution
Analysis shows that the dataset contains more non-smokers than smokers. This suggests a larger representation of individuals who have either never smoked or quit smoking.

Average Cigarette Consumption
Among current smokers, the average number of cigarettes smoked per day is approximately 18.58. This reflects moderate to heavy smoking patterns among active smokers.

Cholesterol Levels
The cholesterol levels of non-smokers are slightly higher than those of smokers. This may seem counterintuitive, but it suggests that cholesterol is influenced by multiple factors beyond smoking alone, such as diet, genetics, or physical activity.

Age Differences
There is no significant difference in the age distribution between smokers and non-smokers when using descriptive statistics. Both groups span similar age ranges, with comparable mean and median ages.

Most Common Blood Pressure Reading
The most frequently recorded blood pressure in the dataset is 130/80. This falls within the range classified as “elevated” or “pre-hypertension,” depending on clinical context.

Heart Rate Comparison
Smokers show a slightly higher average heart rate compared to non-smokers. This is consistent with the physiological effects of nicotine, which is known to stimulate the cardiovascular system.
